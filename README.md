# About
kmc-lotto is a simple library that performs event selection for arbitrary kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations.

This project is developed by the [Van der Ven group](https://labs.materials.ucsb.edu/vanderven/anton/) in the Materials Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
The repository is written and maintained by me, Jonas Kaufman.
Dr. John Goiri implemented the binary tree used for rejection-free event selection and Dr. Sanjeev Kolli provided guidance during development.
